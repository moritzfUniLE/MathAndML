To run the notears algorithm activate your Virtual Environment and navigate to `NoTearsAlgorithmAndData` and run:

`pip install .`

this installs all the needed dependencies from the `setup.py` file.

Once this has finished you can run the algorithm on a CSV file with:

`notears_linear.py path/to/your.csv`

There is a sample data file from the protein signaling dataset located in the bin folder (will be moved in near future)
